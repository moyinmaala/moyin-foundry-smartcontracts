FOUNDRY-FUND-ME-SMARTCONTRACT

Foundry-Fund-Me-Smartcontract is a crowdfunding application written in solidity developed by me after following @Cyfrin foundry tutorials on foundry. This application enables as many addresses as possible to fund the owner of the contract while only the owner of the contract will be able to withdraw the funds.
